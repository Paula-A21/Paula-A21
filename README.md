<h1 align="center">Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Paula Arce</h1>
<h3 align="center">I have 2 years of experience in customer service as a cashier</h3>

<p>I am a person who is always looking for challenges, I like to grow both professionally and personally, whenever I can learn something new I am there. During the pandemic I was looking for a new field that I felt passionate about and I found programming, since then I have continued to perfect myself in this field.</p>

<p>As part of my training in web development I have developed competencies in: UX/UI, HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Git, NodeJS, Express, React, Redux, SQL, Sequelize, Scrum.</p>

My main focus is in the backend area since I have loved puzzles since I was a girl and working in this sector is where I came across the biggest puzzles, and I love solving them. I am someone who prioritizes functionality and efficiency before everything.

I believe that my customer service experience has given me a strong ability to deal with stressful environments, gaining a lot of patience and wisdom in both dealing with customers and keeping a problematic situation under control.
I also developed my leadership skills in the position of Teaching Assistant (TA) for students at Henry Bootcamp, where I had to coordinate a group of new joining students throughout the whole bootcamp experience.
